## Translate

If you are native in other languages in english and feels like making any translation, please do so, by append the
2-digit ISO standard country code to the end of the file, by same name. Also known as [ISO 3166-1][ISO3166-1] and more
precisely [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2][ISO3166-1alpha-2]

E.G. `README.md` becomes `README.de.md` for German.

When you translate any guides, please do add file of the same name in the subfolder of `docs/language/CC` (CC = CountryCode), all in lowercase. 

When you attach media files to the document, post these in the `docs/assets/images/CC/` according to https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/images.html#light_dark_theme
